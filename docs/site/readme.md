# UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields

This website serves as a supplementary resource for our ICCV 2025 paper, “UnMix-NeRF: Spectral Unmixing Meets Neural Radiance Fields.” It is designed to provide an interactive platform to showcase additional results and visualizations related to our work. We invite reviewers to explore our results interactively and see the performance of UnMix-NeRF.

The awesome website template is borrowed from [DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion](https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/) and [Nerfies website](https://nerfies.github.io).
